#How to play:
- use UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT to move around the map
- press SELECT to open the chest and BUTTON A to collect the armor
- currently, enter the spring via the bottom right corner, enter the pool with the armor to win, enter without it to lose

#Things I added:
- finalized maps for both the main map and the spring trial
- collision maps for both maps
- added logic for opening chests
- added complex movement
- added markers for interacting with chests/koroks

#Things to add:
- LotM/blupee sprites
- stamina bar
- spring trial logic
- maybe some korok seeds hidden

#Buggy things:
- I kept trying to add a stamina bar as a sprite to my map but it ruined all my sprites for some reason
- start/instructions tilemaps are fine when first starting the game but weird after i win/lose once
